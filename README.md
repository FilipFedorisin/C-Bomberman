How to install:

1-Download all files into one folder

2-Type $ make all

3-Type $ ./game

4-Type $ ./game debug  // for debug mode ingame

Note:
You will need to download missing libs.
This should run with any system with gcc installed just make sure you have all necessary libs.

This is a school project that i submitted to TUKE, so copying and using it as yours will result
in you getting expelled from school. Use this only for educational and inspirational purposes.

Thank you all.
